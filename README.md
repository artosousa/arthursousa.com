To get started, clone the repository and install its dependencies using your console/terminal

`npm install`

Next, start the development server

`npm start`

As you can see in `package.json`, this will run `webpack-dev-server`. It will mention a url at the top of the terminal output, something like http://localhost:8080. Navigate to this url in your web browser and you should see signs of life.

Most of your work will happen in the `/components` directory. Check out `/components/app.js` too see where things begin!

Happy hacking :)
